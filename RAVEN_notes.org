* what are the jacks and controls?

- two inputs with incoming volumes
- one output

2x or 3x x/y cv and knobs?

16x valueY eg for vocoder/throat

mode

speed/update speed - when far right then we use SPEED in which is TRIGGER IN 

or for vocoder x-channel z-parameter y-value

but maybe there are not so many parameters

* functionality

Main functionality is from split of carrier and filter

** LPC substitution and raven lpc compressions

** vocoder

- bandwidth of bands, transposition of bands (how we assign?) 

** glottal impulses/simulation and filtering

** glottal impulses/simulation and vocal tract models

16 throat sections and control over length (and width?) ?

** other models? where we got with raven, bird song simulations

* what are the glottal impulses

** external reverse LPC

** wavetables

** peaks-spikes/square wave/simple calcs as in wormed_voice workshop

** glottal simulations

* what we can salvage from recent code?

* new/other ideas...

** raven throat shift register delay line
